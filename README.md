## Project overviw

In response to the global outbreak of severe infectious pneumonia since 2020 and the shortage of masks in Taiwan, the government has implemented a name-based mask distribution system. The system requires people to buy masks from pharmacies by their real name registered. Thus, I created this mask map for the public to check the number of masks left in each pharmacy.
